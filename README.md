# Programmers QWERTY
A keyboard remapping for Ubuntu inspired by programmers Dvorak. The remapping looks like this
![Remapping](layout.png)
The old QWERTY layout is shown in black and the remappings are written in red.
To apply this remapping to your machine copy .Xmodmap and run
```bash
xmodmap /path/to/.Xmodmap
```

My own keyboard mapping inspired by programmers Dvorak.
